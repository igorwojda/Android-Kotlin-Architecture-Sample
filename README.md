[![codebeat badge](https://codebeat.co/badges/7f632064-0be5-450f-b29f-f0e1460582ab)](https://codebeat.co/projects/github-com-igorwojda-android-showcase-master)
[![Kotlin Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/kotlin-1.3.41-blue.svg)](http://kotlinlang.org/)

Showcase is a sample project that presents modern approach to [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
[Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system))  
application development. The goal of the project is to provide modular, scalable, maintainable and testable architecture
(suitable for lager teams long
[System Development Life Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_development_life_cycle)). This project takes
advantage of many popular libraries and tools of the Android ecosystem including static analysis and
[CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) setup.

# Improvements

 There are many things I personally want to try, play with and add to `android-show-case` project:
* Support for DayNight MaterialTheme
* Android Dynamic delivery
* Caching layer (memory + disk)
* Add Room
* UI tests (including CI pipeline emulator configuration)
* Data binding
* Custom lint, ktlint and detekt tasks
* Script to update all dependencies in the project, create PR to run all checks
* Continuous deployment (automatically publish app to Google play store using CI)
* ‚Ä¶
* 70+ other things (seriously ü§ìü§£)
