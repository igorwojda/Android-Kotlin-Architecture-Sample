Android Showcase project presents a modern approach to
[Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)) application development. It is a complete sample of
a fully functional Android application.

Project is utilizing modular, scalable, maintainable, and testable [architecture](#architecture), leading
[tech-stack](Tech-stack) and demonstrates the best development practices.

This application may look simple, but it has all the pieces that will provide the rock-solid foundation for the larger
application suitable for bigger teams during extended
[application lifecycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_lifecycle_management).

This project is being maintained to stay up to date with leading industry standards. Please check
the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) page if you want to help.

## Application Scope

The `android-showcase` displays information about music albums. The data is loaded from
the [Last.fm Music Discovery API](https://www.last.fm/api).

The app has a few screens located in multiple feature modules:

- Album list screen - displays list of albums
- Album detail screen - display information about the selected album
- Profile screen - empty (WiP)
- Favourites screen - empty (WiP)

## Architecture

By dividing a problem into smaller and easier to solve sub-problems, we can reduce the complexity of designing and
maintaining a large system. Each module is independent build-block serving a clear purpose. We can think about each
feature as the reusable component, equivalent of [microservice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices) or private
library.

The modularized code-base approach provides a few benefits:

- reusability - enable code sharing and building multiple apps from the same foundation. Apps should be a sum of their
- features where the features are organized as separate modules.
- [separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) - each module has a clear API.
  Feature-related classes live in different modules and can't be referenced without explicit module dependency. We
  strictly control what is exposed to other parts of your codebase.
- features can be developed in parallel eg. by different teams
- each feature can be developed in isolation, independently from other features
- faster build time

### Module Types And Module Dependencies

This diagram presents dependencies between project modules (Gradle sub-projects).

![module_dependencies](https://github.com/igorwojda/android-showcase/blob/main/misc/image/module_dependencies.png?raw=true)

We have three kinds of modules in the application:

- `app` module - this is the main module. It contains code that wires multiple modules together (dependency injection
  setup, `NavHostActivity`, etc.) and fundamental application configuration (retrofit configuration, required
  permissions setup, custom application class, etc.).
- application-specific `library_x` modules that some of the features could depend on. This is helpful if you want to
  share some assets or code only between a few feature modules (currently app has no such modules)
- feature modules - the most common type of module containing all code related to a given feature.

### Feature Module Structure

`Clean architecture` is the "core architecture" of the application, so each `feature module` contains its own set of
Clean architecture layers:

![module_dependencies_layers](https://github.com/igorwojda/android-showcase/blob/main/misc/image/module_dependencies_layers.png?raw=true)

> Notice that the `app` module and `library_x` modules structure differs a bit from the feature module structure.

Each feature module contains non-layer components and 3 layers with a distinct set of responsibilities.

![feature_structure](https://github.com/igorwojda/android-showcase/blob/main/misc/image/feature_structure.png?raw=true)

#### Presentation Layer

This layer is closest to what the user sees on the screen. The `presentation` layer is a mix of `MVVM` (
Jetpack `ViewModel` used to preserve data across activity restart) and
`MVI` (`actions` modify the `common state` of the view and then a new state is edited to a view via `LiveData` to be
rendered).

> `common state` (for each view) approach derives from
> [Unidirectional Data Flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unidirectional_Data_Flow_(computer_science)) and [Redux
> principles](https://redux.js.org/introduction/three-principles).

Components:

- **View (Fragment)** - presents data on the screen and passes user interactions to View Model. Views are hard to test,
  so they should be as simple as possible.
- **ViewModel** - dispatches (through [Kotlin Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/flow.html)) state changes to the view
  and deals with user interactions (these view models are not simply
  [POJO classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_old_Java_object)).
- **ViewState** - common state for a single view
- **NavManager** - singleton that facilitates handling all navigation events inside `NavHostActivity` (instead of
  separately, inside each view)

#### Domain Layer

This is the core layer of the application. Notice that the `domain` layer is independent of any other layers. This
allows making domain models and business logic independent from other layers. In other words, changes in other layers
will not affect `domain` layer eg. changing the database (`data` layer) or screen UI (`presentation` layer) ideally will
not result in any code change withing the `domain` layer.

Components:

- **UseCase** - contains business logic
- **DomainModel** - defines the core structure of the data that will be used within the application. This is the source
  of truth for application data.
- **Repository interface** - required to keep the `domain` layer independent from
  the `data layer` ([Dependency inversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle)).

#### Data Layer

Manages application data. Connect to data sources and provide data through repository to the `domain` layer eg. retrieve
data from the internet and cache the data in disk cache (when device is offline).

Components:

- **Repository** is exposing data to the `domain` layer. Depending on the application structure and quality of the
  external APIs repository can also merge, filter, and transform the data. These operations intend to create
  high-quality data source for the `domain` layer, not to perform any business logic (`domain` layer `use case`
  responsibility).

- **Mapper** - maps `data model` to `domain model` (to keep `domain` layer independent from the `data` layer).
- **RetrofitService** - defines a set of API endpoints.
- **DataModel** - defines the structure of the data retrieved from the network and contains annotations, so Retrofit (
  Moshi) understands how to parse this network data (XML, JSON, Binary...) this data into objects.

### Data Flow

The below diagram presents application data flow when a user interacts with the `album list screen`:

![app_data_flow](https://github.com/igorwojda/android-showcase/blob/main/misc/image/app_data_flow.png?raw=true)

## Dependency Management

Gradle [versions catalog](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/platforms.html#sub:version-catalog) is used as a
centralized dependency management third-party dependency coordinates (group, artifact, version) are shared across all
modules (Gradle projects and subprojects).

All of the dependencies are stored in the [libs.versions.toml](./gradle/libs.versions.toml) file (default location).
The [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) file consists of a few major sections:

- `[versions]` - declare versions that can be referenced by all dependencies
- `[libraries]` - declare the aliases to library coordinates
- `[bundles]` - declare dependency bundles (groups)
- `[plugins]` - declare Gradle plugin dependencies

Each feature module depends on the `feature_base` module, so dependencies are shared without the need to add them
explicitly in each feature module.

Project enables the `TYPESAFE_PROJECT_ACCESSORS` experimental Gradle feature to generate type safe accessors to refer
other projects.

```kotlin
// Before
implementation(project(":feature_album"))

// After
implementation(projects.featureAlbum)
```

## CI Pipeline

CI is utilizing [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). Complete GitHub Actions config is located in
the [.github/workflows](.github/workflows) folder.

### PR Verification

Series of workflows run (in parallel) for every opened PR and after merging PR to the `main` branch:

* `./gradlew lintDebug` - runs Android lint
* `./gradlew detektCheck` - runs detekt and ktlint
* `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest` - run unit tests
* `./gradlew connectedCheck` - run UI tests
* `./gradlew :app:bundleDebug` - create app bundle

## Gradle Update

`./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version=1.2.3`

## What This Project Does Not Cover?

The interface of the app utilizes some of the modern material design components, however, is deliberately kept simple to
focus on application architecture and project config.
